# Prova_Finale_API_2022
This is my C program i submitted for the final test of the Algorithms and Computer Science principles course i attended during my studies at Politecnico di Milano.
In the Input_test folder you can find some files you can use to test the program.

The assignment for the final test was to create a game in which you needed to guess a word that was randomly choosen from a given dictionary of words. You will have N tries to guess the right word and for each guess the program tells you if in the word you are typed in there were letters in the correct space or if there is a letter that happens to be in the word to guess but you did not put it in the right place.
During the game you have the possibility to see the words you still have as your candidates to be the guess word depending on what you learned about the word you are trying to guess from the previous tries.

The difficultness of the test comes with the fact that the the program was going to be tested with a dictionary of words which size was enormous, in the order of milions of words of at least a dozen characters per word (each word has the same size, which is declared to the program by the first input), and the game had a time and memory size restrictions.

I know there are other solutions to the problem and maybe mine is not what you think would be the best but for me it worked.

FINAL RESULT: 30/30.
