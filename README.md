# Prova_Finale_API_2022
This is my C program i submitted for the final test of the Algorithms and Computer Science principles course i attended during my studies at Politecnico di Milano.

The assignment for the final test was to create a game in which you needed to guess a word that was randomly choosen from a given dictionary of words. You will have N tries to guess the right word and for each guess the program tells you if in the word you typed in there were letters in the correct place or if there is a letter that happens to be in the word to guess but you did not put it in the right space.
During the game you have the possibility to see the words you still have as your candidates to be the right guess depending on what you learned with your previous tries.

The difficultness of the test comes with the fact that the the program was going to be tested with a dictionary of words which size was enormous, in the order of milions of words of at least a dozen characters (each word has the same size, which is declared to the program in the first input), and the game had time and memory size restrictions.

FINAL RESULT: 30/30.
